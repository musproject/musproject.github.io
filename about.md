title: About

We are a group of young people who believes that music can make the world better. So we have urge to put our efforts in developing of musical industry by helping people who has passion for music. There are a lot of people in Georgia and throughout the world who have musical talent but it’s only known in family, close friends or only for themselves. So we think we can tackle this issue by launching the innovative project  in Gerogia – MusicPro.ge.

MusicPro is a group of young leaders whose aim is to help gifted people develop their talent, give crucial resources for musical skill-development, opportunities to become well-known and gain additional benefits like monthly prizes, money etc.

Many people don’t have a chance to promote themselves and they play or sing at home, in the street, in subways, with attendance of only close friends or a tiny crowd. Some of them have a video recording of their performance or have a wish to shoot a video and promote it. Such people can send us recording or in case of not having a camera, we can help to shoot a video.

The monthly and regular contests will take place on the site based on a star-rating system which will be used by the site visitors. Furthermore, a site visitor who wants to support a musician, they can share some resources, donate money for the musician’s personal needs listed in their personal profile or just vote with start and give them chance to win monthly contest. There will be different master classes from different artists according to a musician’s genre-inclination. Donation will be determined by a personal profile of musician, where will be the description of musician’s personal needs either money or a musical instrument chosen by the musician themselves.

We believe that this idea will be a great encouragement for people who are keen on music and want to become a real musician in the real world !
